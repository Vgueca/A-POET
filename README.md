# A-POET
A-POET is an implementation of an adaptation of Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) to our own environments and agents. As it is a base for our thesis, we have changed some algorithms and methods that the original and enhanced POET used, in order to build a simpler but useful project from which to develop our thesis.
